Using pro-active remediations, the Configuration Items from the Intune world, to detect, communicate and remove Unsupported applications. An interesting usecase for Proactive Remediation by [@jankeskanke](https://twitter.com/jankeskanke) and [@byteben](https://twitter.com/byteben). Interesting as a solution but probably even more so to demonstrate how much management overhead and security risks you introduce by allowing end-users to install apps by themselves.

## Item 2 ##
One of the things a number of admins has to learn is how to do troubleshooting for workloads delivered from Intune. Several admins out there have years of experience in troubleshooting using #ConfigMgr logs. These quite clearly aren't used for Intune related functionalities. This blog has a pretty extensive amount of detail on how installing a win32 app is installed by the Intune Management Extension.

One of the many pieces of the puzzle you'll need to replace your GPO's with Intune settings management. [Manage Power Settings via Microsoft Intune](https://blog.mindcore.dk/2022/02/manage-power-settings-via-microsoft.html)  a blog by
