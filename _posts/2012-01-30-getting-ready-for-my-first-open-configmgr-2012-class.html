<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am preparing for my very first teach in an open class of ConfigMgr 2012. The material we’ll be using is the manual me and Kent Agerlund (Danish ConfigMgr MVP) wrote. We started writing at beta2 and have updated the material over the months up until RC1.</p>
<p>I am Busy updating it to RC2 as I am typing this, the course is nearly sold out, but still has a couple of seats (literally) left.</p>
<p>The course will take place at the JCAcademy in Louvain, if you want you can still register here: <a title="http://www.jcacademy.be/jca/be-en/course-details.page?Short=MOC213&amp;r=freesearch&amp;q=sccm&amp;i=1" href="http://www.jcacademy.be/jca/be-en/course-details.page?Short=MOC213&amp;r=freesearch&amp;q=sccm&amp;i=1">http://www.jcacademy.be/jca/be-en/course-details.page?Short=MOC213&amp;r=freesearch&amp;q=sccm&amp;i=1</a></p>
<p>the course will cover Site installation, as well as migration. Followed by all the novelties of ConfigMgr 2012. </p>
<p>The course is open to new and seasoned ConfigMgr admins alike, but you’ll probably benefit the most from it if you already havea ConfigMg 2007 background.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kim Oppalfens</p>
