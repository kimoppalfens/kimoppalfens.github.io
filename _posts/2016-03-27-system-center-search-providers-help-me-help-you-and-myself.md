# Intro

﻿The product documentation for System Center used to have a metatag called AppliesToProduct. This allowed Bing searches like the following

**_"software updates" Meta:Search.MSHAttr.appliesToProduct("System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager") site:technet.microsoft.com  
_**

 

Which in turn allowed me to create search providers, so you don't have to recall the meta-tag search syntax, for Internet Explorer, firefox and Chrome, available here:

 And explained and promoted by fellow MVP Brian Mason here: 

**Now, how can you help, you ask?  
**

The new ConfigMgr 1511 & 1602 documentation no longer has the tags. So we can't easily search that doc library anymore, which given the swift pace at which Configuration Manager evolves is painful.

I put in a uservoice request to bring them back on the documentation's team page, so what I'd like to ask, is to give me your vote(s) (You can give multiple votes to 1 item)to bring the item to the attention of Jeff Gilbert and the doc team.

You can find the item here, voting only takes a minute, (Happy voting, and thanks):



And if it's not too much trouble, tweet out that you supported this request from the uservoice page.
