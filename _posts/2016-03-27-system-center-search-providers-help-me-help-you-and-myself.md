The product documentation for System Center used to have a metatag called AppliesToProduct.

# Intro

ï»¿Bing has support for searches like the following

*"software updates" Meta:Search.MSHAttr.appliesToProduct("System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager") site:technet.microsoft.com*

Which in turn allowed me to create search providers, so you don't have to recall the meta-tag search syntax, for Internet Explorer, firefox and Chrome, available here:

And explained and promoted by fellow MVP Brian Mason here: 

Now, how can you help, you ask?

The new ConfigMgr Current Branch documentation no longer has the tags. So we can't easily search the doc library anymore, which given the swift pace at which Configuration Manager evolves is painful.

I put in a Uservoice request to bring them back on the documentation's team page, so what I'd like to ask, is to give me your vote(s) (You can give multiple votes to 1 item)to bring the item to the attention of Jeff Gilbert and the doc team.

You can find the item here, 
[https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/13097310-please-bring-the-meta-tags-back-to-the-documentati](https://configurationmanager.uservoice.com/forums/300492-ideas/suggestions/13097310-please-bring-the-meta-tags-back-to-the-documentati)

voting only takes a minute, (Happy voting, and thanks):



And if it's not too much trouble, tweet out that you supported this request from the Uservoice page.
