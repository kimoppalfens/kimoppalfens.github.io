It's time to announce the next run of our popular WDAC training.

# Intro #
Last year our training sold out, with close to 10 people ending up on the waiting list. We've given the people on the waiting list a little leadtime, but the registrations are now officially open.
We've chosen to partner up with ViaMonstra to allow us to focus even more on the content and less on the training platform that we need to build extending labs.

Tom and I have been investing time in application allowlisting in general and Windows Defender Application control in particular. This training is our yearly event where we pass on everything we've learned over the years.

The training was previously promoted by Jeffrey Sutherland one of the thought leaders at Microsoft in the platform security space and responsible for WDAC.

@TheWMIGuy has a wealth of expertise that he and @TomDegreef have built up. </p>&mdash; Jeffrey Sutherland (@J3ffr3y1974) <a href="https://twitter.com/j3ffr3y1974/status/1443974758614200322">October 1, 2021</a></blockquote>

There's 6 weeks left before we kick off the training, so 6 weeks to grab your seat, don't delay!
