I started off this year stating that 2023 would become the year of Windows Defender Application Control.

# Intro #
After about 6 months into the year, I had a thought exercise as to how that has progressed from our view.

For us the next major event is our WDAC training starting in september. We're still offering the training at the bargain price we introduced it at in 2021, 1395€ or 1695$.
The training was previously shared by Jeffrey Sutherland one of the thought leaders at Microsoft in the platform security space and responsible for WDAC>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you are looking to use WDAC or just want to develop your WDAC skill set, consider this course. 
@TheWMIGuy has a wealth of expertise that he and @TomDegreef have built up. </p>&mdash; Jeffrey Sutherland (@J3ffr3y1974) <a href="https://twitter.com/j3ffr3y1974/status/1443974758614200322">October 1, 2021</a></blockquote>

The training has now been filled to 50% of its capacity. With about 3 months left before it kicks off, there is still some time to register. When we're at capacity we will close registrations (and open up preregisrations for 2024 as we won't re-run it this year.), so don't delay your registration.

# Practical details #
This training is offered at the bargain price of 1395€ or 1695$ as a way to actively promote #WDAC.
