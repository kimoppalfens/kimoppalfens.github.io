<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>It's been a while since I blogged anything, so for those of you wondering yes, I am still alive. Been pretty busy over the past year doing live presentations at several events, but blogging has suffered a bit. This is a quick blog post to announce that I'll be doing another live webinar. I still love doing those, and this one is scheduled for next week already.</p>
<p>The registration page can be found over here: <a href="http://bit.ly/17i2lrj">http://bit.ly/17i2lrj</a></p>
<p>Session title: ConfigMgr 2012: RBA through Z   <br />Session Abstract: System Center Configuration Manager comes with a completely revamped security model. The feature was named Role Based Administration or RBA for short. In this session we'll go beyond the basics of security scopes, roles and collections to give you a deeper understanding of the possibilities of this new security model. Kim Oppalfens, who's been an sms/configmgr/enterprise client management mvp for the past 10 years will walk you through some real life example scenarios and will explain how you work these into the new model.</p>
