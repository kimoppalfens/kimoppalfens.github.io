The attack surface reduction principle should be top of mind for IT admins.

# Intro #
author: Kim Oppalfens

What is meant by attack surface reduction - generally?
The name itself is pretty self-explanatory, the idea behind attack surface reduction is to eliminate vectors of attack by reducing the elements that can be attacked. Plenty of what is already done in the Infosec industry are often forms of attack surface reduction. The general idea, what isn't there, can't be compromised is a pretty strong defense.

My CISSP manual compares attack surface reduction to body armor. The more body armor you have, the less attack surface left. It's a workable analogy, they could've taken it further by giving you massive body armor making you ultra-secure, yet make it impossible for you to move around.

Unfortunately, IT systems are often still very permissive of what is allowed, leading to a vast attack surface. The reasons for that vary, from convenience, over lack of time considering what the attack surfaces are, and various others.
 
The rewards towards your security posture however are significant when you can reduce elements that can be attacked.

What is meant by attack surface reduction - in Microsoft speak?

Microsoft is busy re-branding a ton of Windows 10 (Enterprise) features as Attack Surface Reduction. Not to be confused with Attack Surface Reduction rules/controls which are a sub-component of the Windows Defender Exploit Guard feature set. Part 1of the nice series on [demystifying Attack Surface reduction rules](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-atp/demystifying-attack-surface-reduction-rules-part-1/ba-p/1306420) refers to Attack surface reduction as an umbrella term for all the built-in and cloud-based security features in Windows 10.

### Personal opinion ###

What did I mean when I said attack surface reduction should be top of mind, and double so for folks that manage an organisation's systems management platform. I guess this part will be split up into 2 different main sections. 

One is the lack of progress that we've seen made in the industry of the Windows 10 features that allow attack surface reduction in general. There's a ton of things we're already doing that can be considered attack surface reduction.
