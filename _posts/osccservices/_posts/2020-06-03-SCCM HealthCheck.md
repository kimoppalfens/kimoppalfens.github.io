# Why would I need an SCCM health check in my environment? #

Any good SCCM admin will regularly check their environment to see that all components are healthy and maybe even leverage the built-in management-insights to take action on items that are sub-optimal in the environment.
However, our extended health-check goes beyond these basic checks. Based on a combined experience of 25 years we will examine all aspects of your environment. 

# How does OSCC qualify for an assignment like this? #

OSCC is driven by 2 senior consultants with a strong focus on understanding how the technologies they consult on work under the hood. Both have been awarded the Microsoft MVP award with one of them being an award holder for 15 years in a row. This drive has resulted in multiple deep dive presentations at multiple events around subcomponents of SCCM. These sessions have led to a wealth of info on internal SCCM operations. 

OSCC has worked at close to 100 different customers of different sizes, across different private and public sectors over the years. This has resulted in a ton of experience working with SCCM and has provided a lot of insight into how organizations operate their SCCM environments. 

# Whatâ€™s in scope of this Vulnerability assessment? #

The full SCCM environment will be reviewed for optimal performance and best practice. A report with all findings and recommendations will be provided to the customers. Areas of focus include (but are not limited to):

*	Sccm infrastructure design
*	Feature usage
*	Collection design
*	Client estate
*	WSUS
*	SQL 
*	Bitlocker/Mbam


# What are the deliverables at the end of the assignment? # 
A detailed report will be delivered that will cover all aspects of the assessment with recommendations and/or remediations if applicable.
