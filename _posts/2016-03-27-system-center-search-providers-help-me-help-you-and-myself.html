<p>Hi All, Thanks for visiting,</p>
<p>The product documentation for System Center used to have a metatag called AppliesToProduct. This allowed Bing searches like the following</p>
<p><strong><em>"software updates" Meta:Search.MSHAttr.appliesToProduct("System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager") site:technet.microsoft.com<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p>
 </p>
<p>Which in turn allowed me to create search providers, so you don't have to recall the meta-tag search syntax, for  Internet Explorer, firefox and Chrome, available here:</p>
<p><a href="https://oscc1-public.sharepoint.com/tn-library-searchpage">https://oscc1-public.sharepoint.com/tn-library-searchpage</a>  And explained and promoted by fellow MVP Brian Mason here: <a href="http://mnscug.org/blogs/brian-mason/196-kim-s-chrome-search">http://mnscug.org/blogs/brian-mason/196-kim-s-chrome-search</a>
	</p>
<p><strong>Now, how can you help, you ask?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The new ConfigMgr 1511 &amp; 1602 documentation no longer has the tags. So we can't easily search that doc library anymore, which given the swift pace at which Configuration Manager evolves is painful.</p>
<p>I put in a uservoice request to bring them back on the documentation's team page, so what I'd like to ask, is to give me your vote(s) (You can give multiple votes to 1 item)to bring the item to the attention of Jeff Gilbert and the doc team.</p>
<p>You can find the item here, voting only takes a minute, (Happy voting, and thanks):</p>

<p>And if it's not too much trouble, tweet out that you supported this request from the uservoice page.</p>
