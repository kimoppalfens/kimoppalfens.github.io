This post highlights the most interesting blogs, tweets and articles I've read relating to MEM in the past week.

# Intro #

The weekly must-reads. To stay up-to-date on what's happening in the MEM and Windows management realm I read a ton of stuff, a serious amount of community effort and a similar amount of items Microsoft puts out. The amount of things being put out is all incredibly valuable, and covers all types of knowledge depth imaginable. On a weekly basis I am going to try and shine a light on some of those items that I personally believe you must read. I'll equally add my view as to why I believe this is something you should probably look into. Items appear in random order.

## Item 1 ##
Disclaimer: I am not a huge fan of making users administrators, not even temporarily. The blog starts off with a similar disclaimer that you should analyze whether this aligns with your organization's security practices.
The folks over at SCCMF12Twice (always chuckle at the name), created an interesting way to allow specific users to become admins. Access packages can be used pretty creatively to enable self-service opportunities.

## Item 2 ##
An interesting post + a promise to maintain the solution from [@ccmexec](https://twitter.com/ccmexec). STIGs, Security Technical Implementation Guides, are guides to minimize the exposure to network based attacks. They eliminate the need for all individual organizations to analyze all the possible security settings and come up with a good policy. Pairing that with a script that allows you to build the configuration profile to implement the STIG saves admins yet even more work.

## Item 3 ##
The What's new page for MEM is not something I should probably hightlight, however I've always had an interest in settings management. MacOS in settings catalg, that pretty nifty.
