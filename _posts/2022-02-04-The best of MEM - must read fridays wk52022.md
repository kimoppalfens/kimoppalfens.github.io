This post highlights the most interesting blogs, tweets and articles I've read relating to MEM in the past week.

# Intro #

I figured I'd try and start something new. To stay up-to-date on what's happening in the MEM and Windows management realm I read a ton of stuff. A serious amount of community effort and a similar amount of items Microsoft puts out. The amount of things being put out is all incredibly valuable, and covers all types of knowledge depth imaginable. On a weekly basis I am going to try and shine a light on some of those items that I personally believe you must read. I'll equally add my view as to why I believe this is something you should probably look into. Items appear in random order.

## Item 1 ##
A sneak peek into things to come by @mariussmellum [Checking out Azure AD cross tenant access policies](https://goodworkaround.com/2022/01/12/checking-out-azure-ad-cross-tenant-access-policies/).
I have an interest in Conditional Access & compliance policies, so a sneak peek definitely caught my attention. I particularly like how Marius explained how he managed to find some unreleased documentation for the feature. Kudo's.



## Item 2 ##
Numerous organisations will want to avoid having multiple Teams installations on a business device. You can argue back and forth around removing apps natively built-in, I have a lot of sympathy for the request to remove these. This has a ready made solution to do this in a feature update [Remove built-in Teams app and Chat Icon in Windows 11 during a Feature Update via SetupConfig.ini and SetupComplete.cmd](https://www.imab.dk/remove-built-in-teams-app-and-chat-icon-in-windows-11-during-a-feature-update-via-setupconfig-ini-and-setupcomplete-cmd/)


## Item 3 ##
[Remote help for Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Manager](https://4sysops.com/archives/remote-help-for-intune-and-microsoft-endpoint-manager/)
A post on Remote help, a feature largely missing in action and desparately needed in the new increased work from home scenario. Jörgen gives a great overview of what the feature is and what it is not. Like Jörgen I hope we get an unattended admin option soon, that's the biggest gap according to me. Providing remote support is something I can handle through a teams screen sharing session. The bit about doing admin-level stuff in a user's session has always made me nervous. 

## Item 4 ##
A somewhat a-typical one to close this week out, this tweet by @DrAzureAD peaked my interest quite a bit. [https://twitter.com/DrAzureAD/status/1488404472283938819](Pentester Academy's Azure AD Bootcamp) by @nikhil_mitt. Not a blog, just a short tweet, and not exactly the MEM but the AzureAd space, but boy it kept me busy. I've tried to clear my schedule but failed, this is something I really want to attend soon'ish.
