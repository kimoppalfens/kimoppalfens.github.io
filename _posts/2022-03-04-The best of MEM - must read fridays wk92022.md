This post highlights the most interesting blogs, tweets and articles I've read relating to MEM in the past week.

# Intro #

To stay up-to-date on what's happening in the MEM and Windows management realm I read a ton of stuff. A serious amount of community effort and a similar amount of items Microsoft puts out. The amount of things being put out is all incredibly valuable, and covers all types of knowledge depth imaginable. On a weekly basis I am going to try and shine a light on some of those items that I personally believe you must read. I'll equally add my view as to why I believe this is something you should probably look into. Items appear in random order.

## Item 1 ##

Using pro-active remediations, the Configuration Items from the Intune world, to detect, communicate and remove Unsupported applications. An interesting usecase for Proactive Remediation by [@jankeskanke](https://twitter.com/jankeskanke) and [@byteben](https://twitter.com/byteben). Interesting as a solution but probably even more so to demonstrate how much management overhead and security risks you introduce by allowing end-users to install apps by themselves.

## Item 2 ##
One of the things a number of admins has to learn is how to do troubleshooting for workloads delivered from Intune. Several admins out there have years of experience in troubleshooting using #ConfigMgr logs. These quite clearly aren't used for Intune related functionalities. This blog has a pretty extensive amount of detail on how installing a win32 app is installed by the Intune Management Extension.

## Item 3 ##
One of the many pieces of the puzzle you'll need to replace your GPO's with Intune settings management. [Manage Power Settings via Microsoft Intune](https://blog.mindcore.dk/2022/02/manage-power-settings-via-microsoft.html)  a blog by
