# ATKey Pro Features #
- **No More Password**: Portable Fingerprint enabled USB dongle for Windows, Mac, Chromebook, and Linux, enjoying the passwordless login to Microsoft Azure AD or FIDO2 services. 
- **High Performance:** The most compact with the best fingerprint user experience USB security key. FAR < 1/50,000, FRR <2%, and matching time <1 second. 
- **No additional application/driver required**: With our patent "standalone enrollment," you can register up to 10 fingerprints to the ATKey Pro much easier and faster than all the existing products. 
- **Fingerprint is your best password**: With the built-in Egis fingerprint sensor, you can enjoy the risk-free login with something you have (ATKey Pro), something you know (Pin Code), and something you are (Fingerprint).

# Most Compact Design with Superb Performance #
- *Highly Secure Design*: Built upon the FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Certified Broadcom® BCM5810X microcontroller with SecureBoot & SecureXIP enabled. Store encrypted fingerprint templates inside the hardware chip, and cannot disclose outside the ATKey Pro. 
- *Best Fingerprint experience*: Integrate with the Egis fingerprint sensor, so users only need a slight "touch" for fingerprint matching. 
- *Portable, Slim & Light*: Both Type-A and Type-C are weight only 3.3g, and the size is only 15mm x 26.5mm x 8.3mm. 
- *Most Convenience Passwordless Login*: Unlike most existing password management solutions where user credentials such as username and password are stored either in the web browser cache or on a remote server, AuthenTrend partners with Broadcom to introduce Bio-Safe which can securely store credentials within ATKey’s CV security chip. Credentials stored in the CV are encrypted and accessible only after a user successfully verifies their fingerprint through the authentication process
