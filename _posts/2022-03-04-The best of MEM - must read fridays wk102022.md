This post highlights the most interesting blogs, tweets and articles I've read relating to MEM in the past week.

# Intro #

To stay up-to-date on what's happening in the MEM and Windows management realm I read a ton of stuff. A serious amount of community effort and a similar amount of items Microsoft puts out. The amount of things being put out is all incredibly valuable, and covers all types of knowledge depth imaginable. On a weekly basis I am going to try and shine a light on some of those items that I personally believe you must read. I'll equally add my view as to why I believe this is something you should probably look into. Items appear in random order.

## Item 1 ##

[@managed_blog](https://twitter.com/managed_blog) has been busy on a series around what I'd call modernizing your systems managemement. I don't use the term modern often as it often feels like people are trying to sell me something without having a clear benefit other than, it's new, it must be good. Sean has been on a series of solving everyday challenges and/or provide additional features and functionality using Online  from Azure and integrate them with stuff most of you already have. The latest post is a mix between Azure Automation and MEMCM called. [Running an Azure Automation runbook to update MEMCM Primary User](https://www.modernendpoint.com/managed/Running-an-Azure-Automation-runbook-to-update-MEMCM-Primary-User/) The posts are typically somewhat longer, but worth your time. The list of the build-up to this in tis series with all other posts are at the end which helps you get an interesting peak into the entire thought process of doing things like this.

## Item 2 ##
If you're somehow involved in Windows Driver management at your organization and haven't heard about Maurice's Driver Automation Tool, than you're doing it wrong. If you're somehow involved in Windows Driver management and aren't using the Driver Automation tool, there's a very highly likelikhood you're doing it wrong. Either way you owe it to yourself to have a look at the latest release. If you do use the Driver Automation Tool, I'd suggest an, at least, annual review of the version you're using and what new opportunities the new builds bring.
