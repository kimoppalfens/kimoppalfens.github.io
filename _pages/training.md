This training is geared towards administrators that are starting or have recently started on-boarding Windows 10 within their corporation. It handles the new servicing model of Windows 10, and its implications on the IT processes within a company. All of this coupled with a ton of detail around deployment, management and the new security features provided with Windows 10.
System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) will be used during the training as the main management tool for deploying and servicing Windows 10.
